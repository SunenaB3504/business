# Low-Level Design (LLD) for chapter_template.html

## 1. Data Loading
- On page load, fetch `content.json`.
- Extract the relevant chapter object (e.g., `chapter1`).

## 2. Section Rendering (by ID)
- `story-content`: Render each story block (`title`, `text`).
- `mindmap-content`: Render mindmap as a recursive accordion, showing `title`, `explanation`, `example`, `keyPoints`, `definition`.
- `case-study-content`: For each case study, show `title`, `scenario`, and render each question with type, marks, word limit, and input area.
- `flashcards`: Render flippable cards with navigation and count.
- `exercises-content`: Render MCQ, one-word, short answer, and true/false exercises, with a “Check Answers” button and feedback area.
- `long-answer-content`: Render long answer questions with show/hide buttons for each answer length.

## 3. Interactivity
- Add event listeners for:
  - Flashcard navigation.
  - TTS controls (play, pause, stop) for story and long answers.
  - “Check Answers” button for exercises.
  - Show/hide answer buttons for long answers.
  - Case study answer input and validation (if required).

## 4. Error Handling
- Use `global-debug-area` to display errors or debug info.

## 5. Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes for accordions, and TailwindCSS for responsive design.
